        <section class="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This project sprung from an open brief from a school project: Use
            design thinking to design something that solves a real problem. In a
            group of 3 and with a world of possibilities, we found something we
            were truly interested in solving. One of the group members works as
            a nurse, and has heard from patients how difficult it is to get hold
            of assistance devices from Hjelpemiddelsentralen.
          </p>

          <h3>The current process is complex and digitally outdated</h3>
          <p>
            Hjelpemiddeldatabasen.no is a database of all available assistance
            devices, where users can read about them. The website is packed with
            categories and lots of information.
          </p>
          <div class="two-images">
            <img
              class="two-images-img"
              src="/assets/my-devices/database-homepage.jpg"
              alt="Hjelpemiddeldatabasen home page. Links to other pages. Some of the links cover the photo of a road sign saying 'Change just ahead'"
            />
            <img
              class="two-images-img"
              src="/assets/my-devices/database.jpg"
              alt="Screenshot of the database, a text-heavy page with links to categories for assistance devices"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            NAV has several websites, and we saw that the process of getting
            information about assistance devices to have them delivered and
            maintained in their daily lives was not easy or streamlined.
          </p>

          <h3>Norway's approaching elderly wave and independence</h3>
          <p>
            The Norwegian government and healthcare section is looking for ways
            to promote independence for the population by helping them to live
            in their homes for as long as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution we created seeks to alleviate some of the strain on
            Norway's healthcare system by fostering a cohesive and cooperative
            way to manage assistance devices. The current process makes users
            who need assistance devices heavily depend on relatives to get hold
            of these, making users less independent in their own lives. Some
            users are dependent on caregivers, and the process should make it
            easier to include them.
          </p>

        <section class="method">
          <h2>Learning more about the problem</h2>
          <p>
            Following the design thinking methodology, we created research goals
            to guide our process into learning more about our potential users.
          </p>

          <div class="method-div">
            <p class="txt-details">Literature reviews</p>
            <p>
              15-18% of Norway's population has a disability, and 440 613 people
              used at least one technical aid as of 2022.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="method-div">
            <p class="txt-details">Competitor analysis</p>
            <p>
              As there are no direct competitors of the digital solution we were
              creating, we chose three digital services that provided
              information about assistance devices or renting items online.
            </p>
            <p>
              This includes a visually appealing design, a safe way to log in,
              easy ways to contact support, and provide status updates for users
              to stay in control
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="method-div">
            <p class="txt-details">User interviews</p>
            <p>
              We had to go through two rounds of user interviews, as we
              identified a different problem area than we first set out to
              research during the first round.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were more focused on the delivery of assistance devices, but it
              seemed that other problems were more prevalent:
              <b>Users need easier access to information.</b>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Both research rounds were analyzed separately using affinity
            mapping, and provided us with valuable insights we brought with us
            throughout the project:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="list-item">
              Users are dependent on healthcare professionals or relatives when
              applying for and receiving assistance devices, as the process is
              difficult to complete alone
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              Users needs to have support easily available in case of questions,
              inquiries or problems
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              Users wants updates throughout the process of applying and
              receiving
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              Making information easily available makes the users better
              equipped to live independently, and will help relieve pressure on
              healthcare and municipality workers
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>
            Our idea provides the user with necessary information up front about
            important updates with their assistance devices.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before creating a final solution, we went through the iterative
            process of creating wireframes and testing them, improving the
            wireframes and testing again. Feedback from the user testing rounds
            gave us valuable insights:
          </p>
          <p>
            Some parts of the app were difficult to navigate, mostly because of
            the name and icon. However, information on other pages was presented
            intuitively and simply, making it easy for them to complete the task
            we gave them. We also learned that users appreciate having multiple
            options to find the information they need, so they can use the
            option they prefer. For instance, a quick photo guide instead of
            reading a manual to learn how to use the assistance device.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="challenges">
          <h2>
            We did not have the opportunity to test with users with assistance
            devices
          </h2>
          <p>
            For this project, we struggled with recruiting actual users of
            assistance devices. We lack feedback from and testing with them that
            would help us see if our solution is actually acessible and helpful.
            We did the best we could with the time and resources we had for the
            project duration, and managed to gather some insight from people who
            have used Hjelpemiddelsentralen for relatives, or people who have
            worked with users of assistance devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also used our knowledge of accessibility guidelines such as WCAG,
            to ensure better accessibility as our user group mainly consists of
            elderly people and people who use assistance devices that might need
            more help with digital solutions
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal was to help users with assistance devices, as well as help
            relieve anyone who works with them by encouraging independence. This
            could potentially play a part in preparing Norway for the
            anticipated wave of the elderly population.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            Our solution was created from the research we did, our ideation and
            feedback from user testing. We explored how we can help users with
            assistance devices be independent, and how we can help them and/or
            their caregivers manage the process from start to finish. The goal
            was to help them stay updated about applications, deliveries,
            information about devices and how to reach out for support.
